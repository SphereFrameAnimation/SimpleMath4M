# SimpleMath4M
A plugin for Autodesk Maya adding simplified math nodes. Many of the math nodes within Maya contain a lot of extra inputs and outputs which are largely unnecessary and make make complex node networks challenging to read. This plugin seeks to solve this dilemma by adding nodes which are far more simplified, exposing only the necessary I/O channels and improving the readability of networks.

## Roadmap (as of 23/09/2023)
