# SimpleMath4M
A plugin for Autodesk Maya adding simplified math nodes. Many of the math nodes within Maya contain a lot of extra inputs and outputs which are largely unnecessary and make make complex node networks challenging to read. This plugin seeks to solve this dilemma by adding nodes which are far more simplified, exposing only the necessary I/O channels and improving the readability of networks.

## Roadmap (as of 04/12/2023)
- Basic arithmetic [Completed]
- Single variable functions [Completed]
- Numeric conditionals [Completed]
- Vector math (Multi-variable math) [Completed]
- Basic matrix math

## Setup local development environment for Windows (Visual Studio)
1) Download and setup the Maya Devkit as per [Autodesk's documentation](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2024/ENU/?guid=Maya_SDK_Setting_up_your_build_Windows_environment_64_bit_html)
2) Create a fork of this repo in your github account and create a local clone using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/SimpleMath4M.git
```
3) Navigate to the cloned repository and run the CMake generation command (make sure you have installed CMake 3.27 or higher):
```bash
cmake -B ./build -S ./ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```
4) Open the directory in Visual Studio. Go to Project > CMake settings for SimpleMath4M > Show Advanced settings. Change the ``CMake generator`` to "Visual Studio 17 2022 Win64" and the ``CMake Executable`` to the path of your CMake executable. Save these settings by pressing ``CTRL + S``
5) Your development environment should be setup correctly. If you make any changes to the CMake configuration (such as modifying ``CMakeLists.txt``) visual studio should automatically regenerate the CMake build files. If not or if you are outside of your IDE you will need to re-run the command in step 3.
6) To build SimpleMath4M simply navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
cmake --build ./build
```
7) The ``.mll`` file will be located under ``./build/debug/``. You can then copy this file into the ``devkitBase/plug-ins/plug-ins`` directory you created in step 1. To test the plugin, open Maya and load the plugin through the plugins manager.

## Setup local development environment for MacOS (XCode) [Currently unavailable]
